This project was created to expedite the process of patient communication. By sending automated SMS text messages from biometric data 
readings, Mobile Medic equips smart watch users with the ability to send feedback to doctors and loved ones seamlessly.

The code was designed in Mac OS native language Swift in the Xcode IDE. The app is only supported on iOS devices at the moment, but 
future developments include support for Android phones and smartgear. Other developments include better server times, access to more 
biometric data, and optimizations to the UI. 

All code is open source.
